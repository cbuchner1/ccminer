  -L, --lookup-gap      Divides the per-hash memory requirement by this factor
                        by storing only every N'th value in the scratchpad.

      --texture-cache   comma separated list of flags (0/1/2) specifying
                        which of the CUDA devices shall use the texture
                        cache for mining. Kepler devices may profit.
      --no-autotune     disable auto-tuning of kernel launch parameters

CryptoNight specific options:

>>> Examples <<<


Example for Heavycoin Mining on heavycoinpool.com with a single gpu in your system
    ccminer -t 1 -a heavy -o stratum+tcp://stratum01.heavycoinpool.com:5333 -u <<username.worker>> -p <<workerpassword>> -v 8


Example for Heavycoin Mining on hvc.1gh.com with a dual gpu in your system
    ccminer -t 2 -a heavy -o stratum+tcp://hvcpool.1gh.com:5333/ -u <<WALLET>> -p x -v 8


Example for Fuguecoin solo-mining with 4 gpu's in your system and a Fuguecoin-wallet running on localhost
    ccminer -q -s 1 -t 4 -a fugue256 -o http://localhost:9089/ -u <<myusername>> -p <<mypassword>>


Example for Fuguecoin pool mining on dwarfpool.com with all your GPUs
    ccminer -q -a fugue256 -o stratum+tcp://erebor.dwarfpool.com:3340/ -u YOURWALLETADDRESS.1 -p YOUREMAILADDRESS


Example for Groestlcoin solo mining
    ccminer -q -s 1 -a groestl -o http://127.0.0.1:1441/ -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD

Example for Boolberry
    ccminer -a wildkeccak -o stratum+tcp://bbr.suprnova.cc:7777 -u tpruvot.donate -p x -k http://bbr.suprnova.cc/scratchpad.bin -l 64x360

Example for Scrypt-N (2048) on Nicehash
    ccminer -a scrypt:10 -o stratum+tcp://stratum.nicehash.com:3335 -u 3EujYFcoBzWvpUEvbe3obEG95mBuU88QBD -p x

For solo-mining you typically use -o http://127.0.0.1:xxxx where xxxx represents
the rpcport number specified in your wallet's .conf file and you have to pass the same username
and password with -O (or -u -p) as specified in the wallet config.

The wallet must also be started with the -server option and/or with the server=1 flag in the .conf file

>>> Configuration files <<<

With the -c parameter you can use a json config file to set your prefered settings.
An example is present in source tree, and is also the default one when no command line parameters are given.
This allow you to run the miner without batch/script.


>>> API and Monitoring <<<

With the -b parameter you can open your ccminer to your network, use -b 0.0.0.0:4068 if required.
On windows, setting 0.0.0.0 will ask firewall permissions on the first launch. Its normal.

Default API feature is only enabled for localhost queries by default, on port 4068.

You can test this api on linux with "telnet <miner-ip> 4068" and type "help" to list the commands.
Default api format is delimited text. If required a php json wrapper is present in api/ folder.

I plan to add a json format later, if requests are formatted in json too..


>>> Additional Notes <<<

This code should be running on nVidia GPUs ranging from compute capability
3.0 up to compute capability 5.2. Support for Compute 2.0 has been dropped
so we can more efficiently implement new algorithms using the latest hardware
features.

  Aug. 18th 2014  add X14, X15, Whirl, and Fresh algos,
                  also add colors and nvprof cmd line support

  June 15th 2014  add X13 and Diamond Groestl support.
                  Thanks to tsiv and to Bombadil for the contributions!

  June 14th 2014  released Killer Groestl quad version which I deem
                  sufficiently hard to port over to AMD. It isn't
                  the fastest option for Compute 3.5 and 5.0 cards,
                  but it is still much faster than the table based
                  versions.

  May 10th 2014   added X11, but without the bells & whistles
                  (no killer Groestl, SIMD hash quite slow still)

  May 6th 2014    this adds the quark and animecoin algorithms.

  May 3rd 2014    add the MjollnirCoin hash algorithm for the upcomin
                  MjollnirCoin relaunch.

                  Add the -f (--diff) option to adjust the difficulty
                  e.g. for the erebor Dwarfpool myr-gr SaffronCoin pool.
                  Use -f 256 there.

  May 1st 2014    adapt the Jackpot algorithms to changes made by the
                  coin developers. We keep our unique nVidia advantage
                  because we have a way to break up the divergence.
                  NOTE: Jackpot Hash now requires Compute 3.0 or later.

  April, 27 2014  this release adds Myriad-Groestl and Jackpot Coin.
                  we apply an optimization to Jackpot that turns this
                  into a Keccak-only CUDA coin ;) Jackpot is tested with
                  solo--mining only at the moment.

  March, 27 2014  Heavycoin exchange rates soar, and as a result this coin
                  gets some love: We greatly optimized the Hefty1 kernel
                  for speed. Expect some hefty gains, especially on 750Ti's!

                  By popular demand, we added the -d option as known from
                  cudaminer.

                  different compute capability builds are now provided until
                  we figure out how to pack everything into a single executable
                  in a Windows build.

  March, 24 2014  fixed Groestl pool support

                  went back to Compute 1.x for cuda_hefty1.cu kernel by
                  default after numerous reports of ccminer v0.2/v0.3
                  not working with HeavyCoin for some people.

  March, 23 2014  added Groestlcoin support. stratum status unknown
                  (the only pool is currently down for fixing issues)

  March, 21 2014  use of shared memory in Fugue256 kernel boosts hash rates
                  on Fermi and Maxwell devices. Kepler may suffer slightly
                  (3-5%)

                  Fixed Stratum for Fuguecoin. Tested on dwarfpool.

  March, 18 2014  initial release.
