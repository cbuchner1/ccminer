
You can use ./build.sh to configure and build with default options.

It is advised to run ./autogen.sh before ./configure (autoconf and automake
need to be installed on your system for autogen.sh to work)

./configure has an option named --with-cuda that allows you to specify
where your CUDA 6.5 toolkit is installed (usually /usr/local/cuda,
but some distros may have a different default location)


** How to compile on Fedora 22 (2015) **

# Step 1: gcc and dependencies
dnf install gcc gcc-c++ automake
dnf install jansson-devel openssl-devel libcurl-devel zlib-devel pciutils-devel

# Step 2: nvidia drivers (Download common linux drivers from nvidia site)
dnf install kernel-devel
modprobe -r nouveau
./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-346.72.run

# Step 3: CUDA SDK (Download from nvidia archive)
dnf install cuda-repo-fedora20-6-5-prod-6.5-19.x86_64.rpm
dnf install cuda-minimal-build-6-5.x86_64

# add the nvcc binary path to the system
ln -s /usr/local/cuda-6.5 /usr/local/cuda
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/cuda/bin' > /etc/profile.d/cuda.sh

# add the cudart library path to the system
echo /usr/local/cuda/lib64 > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/cuda.conf
ldconfig

# Step 4: Fix the toolkit warning with gcc 5.1
edit the file /usr/local/cuda/include/host_config.h
and comment/delete the line 82 : #error -- unsupported GNU version! gcc 4.9

./build.sh

./ccminer -n
